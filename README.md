# Evergreen MVP

_Evergreen_ is a summer project at Harvey Mudd College where we prototype foundational features of an app that would be further developed and polished by a clinic team of senior CS students. The _Evergreen MVP_ is developed using React Typescript, TailwindCSS and Firebase. The various features of the app revolve around educating children from age 4 to 8 about urban forests.

The following are the features that have been developed so far during this project:

- User login via Google account
- Working with Firebase
- Using Tailwind for styling
- Using React Router for switching between React pages
- A game where you click on bugs and squash them if they're bad
- A page that teaches you digestable amounts of information displayed on card components
- A game where you drag and drop things in the correct order
- A page where you can log entries of your favorite tree as it grows

_Evergreen_ team members include: Htoomyat Naing, Mo Kyn supervised by Professor Zachary Dodds.
